"More specifically, this work intends to answer the following research question: \\
   Given a trajectory extracted from GPS data, is it possible to obtain a useful characterization that can help the identification of the transportation modes used in urban scenarios?" 
-- Cardoso et al. \cite{cardoso2022leveraging}


"Can machine learning techniques be effectively applied to GPS trajectory data to extract relevant features and accurately classify transportation modes (walking, cycling, car, bus, train) in urban environments?" -gmn

"How can we effectively analyze GPS trajectory data to identify and classify different transportation modes (walking, cycling, car, bus, train) in urban environments, thereby contributing to a better understanding of urban mobility patterns?"   -gmn2

“To what extent can GPS trajectory data be utilized to accurately classify different transportation modes (walking, cycling, car, bus, train) in urban environments and contribute to improved urban planning and transportation management?”  -gmn3
